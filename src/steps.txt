Create actions folder
in this create index.js

in this we will write all actions

* create reducers folder and in this
  we will create incDec.js for reducer.

  now we will make the basic ui

*Now we have created index.js in actions folder so in that we will create actions for increment and decrement.

*Now in reducer in incNum we will write logic

* Create index.js in reducer for the rootReducer and we will use combineReducer() to combine all reducers.

* Now we have to add everything in store.
so we will create store.js in src.

and in this 1st we will import createStore
and rootReducer bcz the whole data will be in rootReducer

now create the store  
and for devTools paste this code there  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()


and in main index.js 
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));


Now in index.js main file

we have to provide store to all the app, so any component can use that.

so we will import Provider

and wrap App in it and we'll pass store to it.

**
Now we want to show the data on ui

so we have to get the data from store.

so we have useSelector hook

const state = useSelector((state) => state.changeTheNum)
//changeTheNum is in incDec

console the state to see what we got.

then we want to triger the actions on clicking of the buttons

so we will import the actions.

and we will use useDispatch to trigger the actions ;

then action will call the reducer fn

const dispatch = useDispatch()

dispatch(incNum()) // onclick of increment
dispatch(decNum()) // onclick of decrement
